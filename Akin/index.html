<h2> About</h2>
<hr>

<p> <div style="color: beige;">It was founded in Ankara in 1999. The band performed in many places under the name Raindog, and at the time of the album, they took a Turkish name and named it Zakkum.
</div></p>

<p> <div style="color: beige;">  While Cem Senyücel and Yusuf Demirkol were in separate musical lives, the idea of ​​forming a band brought them together. Soon the foundations of the group were laid. The other members of the group, who first performed at Cinema Bar, have undergone constant change, just like many of the venues they have appeared in. By 2004, they were not content with making covers, they also started to compose their own songs and put their own works alongside the cover songs they made from bands such as Placebo, Radiohead, Morrissey, The Smiths, The Cure, Smashing Pumpkins, Suede. </p>
</div>

<p> <div style="color: beige;"> Thus, the core team of the group is now established. The band, which entered 2005 with the quartet of Yusuf Demirkol on vocals, Salih Eren Parlakgümüş on electric guitar, Ali Emre Yılmaztürk on bass guitar and Cem Senyücel on drums, is preparing for an album, aiming to release the album at the beginning of 2006 at the latest. Another important event for the group in 2005 was that they started their program in Istanbul - Kadıköy. The band, which shuttled between Ankara and Istanbul, postponed the album they had targeted at the beginning of 2006, first to October and then to the beginning of 2007. Their first album, Zehr-i Zakkum, was released in January 2007. The manager of the Zakkum group is Ezgi Özcan.

<p> <div style="color: beige;">The instrument recordings of the album were made at Raks Marşandiz Studios (RMS), and the vocal recordings were made at Mine Erkaya's studio. The photos of the album, which was released at the end of January 2007 under the Orta Dünya Muzik label, were made by Fethi Mağara, and the cover, logo and visual designs were made by Fethi Mağara. It belongs to Mustafa Kural. The music video for the song "Ah Chocolate", the first single from the album, belongs to Murad Küçük. The shooting took place at Film Street Studios in Maslak.
</div>


<p> <div style="color: beige;">After Yusuf Demirkol and Cem Senyücel completed their military service, Zakkum shot the fifth and last video of the first album for their song "You Understand" in March 2010. The video, which took two days to shoot in Ankara and was shot in 35 mm, covered the themes of separation, suffering and longing. The director of photography was Yiğit Şener, the art director was Berk Büyükakın and the production designer was Deniz Küçük.
</div>


<p> <div style="color: beige;">The most important feature of the group is that they have captured the marginality that is not seen much in Turkey, and have created their style in accordance with the Glam Rock they perform.
